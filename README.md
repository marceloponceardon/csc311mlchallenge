# Description
The machine learning challenge for CSC 311 at the University of Toronto.
Your task is to use the provided data to build a **classifier** related to this data set, likely to predict which city a student is referring to in their response.
__The exact task will be confirmed after the course staff has a chance to experiment with the data.__

The classifier should be able to perform well on an unseen test set that will __not__ be shared with you.
